EveSpeak3
=========

Update Dec. 17, 2012
  I am looking for help in continuing this project. As I've now made it through exams, I'm planning to work on this further. If anyone is interested in collaborating on this with me, drop me a line either in EvE (Librarat) or email me directly (see my website for contact information)

Yet another attempt at a nice, clean and easy to use EvE API based authentication system for TeamSpeak3, and hopefully phpBB integration, too.
